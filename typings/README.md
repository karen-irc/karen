# Type Defenitions for TypeScript

This directory contains type defenition files for TypeScript.

**DO NOT EDIT BY HAND FILES UNDER THIS DIRECTORY**.

## Notices

- Commit `d.ts` files under this directory if you install/update them.
  - Travis CI is failed with very high frequency because `typings install` will be limitted by
    Github's API limitations. So we avoid it by to manage `d.ts` files under git's controll.
