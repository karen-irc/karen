karen is a [shout](https://github.com/erming/shout)-fork just for highly personal use.

So maybe, no releases are planned.
If you would like to use it, just clone & run it.

## Motivation

shout is the super great web-based IRC client supporting a lot of features; multiple networks, neat UI and so on.
However, sometimes, we would like to add some dirty hacks for our personal purpose.
For example, we modified an IRC twitter gateway (atig) to add twitter profile icon URLs into IRC messages. And we would like to add the feature showing it in an IRC client. But, this is non IRC standard message format and highly client dependent dirty hack. This is why we forked, why karen is intended for highly personal use and why we have no plan to release karen.
